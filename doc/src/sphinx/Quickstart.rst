Quickstart
==========

In this section we'll use Finagle to build a very simple HTTP server
that is also an HTTP client — an HTTP proxy. We assume that you
are familiar with Scala_ (if not, may we recommend 
`Scala School <http://twitter.github.com/scala_school/>`_?).

.. _Scala: http://www.scala-lang.org

The entire example is available, together with a self-contained
script to launch sbt, in the finagle git repository:

::

	$ git clone https://github.com/twitter/finagle.git
	$ cd finagle/doc/src/sphinx/code/quickstart
	$ ./sbt compile

Setting up SBT
--------------

We'll use sbt_ to build our project. Finagle is published to Maven Central,
so little setup is needed: put the following into a file called `build.sbt` in 
a fresh directory:

.. parsed-literal::

	name := "quickstart"
	
	version := "1.0"
	
	libraryDependencies += "com.twitter" %% "finagle-http" % "|release|"

Any file in this directory will now be compiled by `sbt`. In order to simplify
installation, we recommend that you use the bootstrap `sbt` script available
here_, or:

::

	$ curl https://raw.github.com/twitter/finagle/master/doc/src/sphinx/code/quickstart/sbt > code/sbt
	$ chmod u+rx code/sbt

.. _here: https://raw.github.com/twitter/finagle/master/doc/src/sphinx/code/quickstart/sbt
.. _sbt: http://www.scala-sbt.org

A minimal HTTP server
---------------------

We'll need to import a few things into our namespace.

.. includecode:: code/quickstart/Server.scala#imports

`Service` is the interface used to represent a server or a client
(:doc:`about which more later <ServicesAndFilters>`). `Http` is Finagle's HTTP
client and server. Finagle's HTTP implementation uses Netty_
underneath, so `org.jboss.netty.handler.codec.http._` imports the
datatypes for HTTP (requests, responses, and so on).

.. _Netty: http://netty.io/

Next, we'll define a `Service` to serve our HTTP requests:

.. includecode:: code/quickstart/Server.scala#service

Services are functions from a request type (`HttpRequest`) 
to a `Future` of a response type (`HttpResponse`). Put another
way: given a *request*, we must promise a *response* some
time in the future. In this case, we just return a trivial HTTP-200
response immediately (through `Future.value`), using the same
version of HTTP with which the request was dispatched.

Now that we've defined our `Service`, we'll need to export
it. We use Finagle's Http server for this:

.. includecode:: code/quickstart/Server.scala#builder

The `serve` method takes a *bind target* (which port to expose the
server) and the service itself. The server is responsible for
listening for incoming connections, translating the HTTP wire protocol
into `HttpRequest` objects, and translating our `HttpResponse` object
back into its wire format, sending replies back to the client.

The complete server:

.. includecode:: code/quickstart/Server.scala

We're now ready to run it:

::

	$ ./sbt 'run-main Server'

Which exposes an HTTP server on port 8080 which
dispatches requests to `service`:

::

	$ curl -D - localhost:8080
	HTTP/1.1 200 OK
	$

Using clients
-------------

In our server example, we define a `Service` to respond to requests.
Clients work the other way around: we're given a `Service` to *use*. Just as we
exported services with the `Http.serve`, method, we can *import* them
with a `Http.newService`, giving us an instance of 
`Service[HttpRequest, HttpResponse]`:

.. includecode:: code/quickstart/Client.scala#builder

`client` is a `Service` to which we can dispatch an `HttpRequest`
and in return receive a `Future[HttpResponse]` — the promise of an
`HttpResponse` (or an error) some time in the future. We furnish
`newService` with the *target* of the client: the host or set of hosts
to which requests are dispatched.

.. includecode:: code/quickstart/Client.scala#dispatch

Now that we have `response`, a `Future[HttpResponse]`, we can register
a callback to notify us when the result is ready:

.. includecode:: code/quickstart/Client.scala#callback

Completing the client:

.. includecode:: code/quickstart/Client.scala

which in turn is run by:

::

	$ ./sbt 'run-main Client'
	GET success: DefaultHttpResponse(chunked: false)
	HTTP/1.1 200 OK
	Date: Tue, 29 Jan 2013 23:28:11 GMT
	Expires: -1
	Cache-Control: private, max-age=0
	...

Putting it together
-------------------

Now we're ready to create an HTTP proxy! Notice the symmetry above:
servers *provide* a `Service`, while a client *uses* it. Indeed, an HTTP
proxy can be constructed by just replacing the service we defined with
one that was imported with a `Http.newService`:

.. includecode:: code/quickstart/Proxy.scala

And we can run it and dispatch requests to it:

::

	$ ./sbt 'run-main Proxy' &
	$ curl -D - localhost:8080
	HTTP/1.1 302 Found
	Location: http://www.google.com/
	Cache-Control: private
	Content-Type: text/html; charset=UTF-8
	X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff
	...
