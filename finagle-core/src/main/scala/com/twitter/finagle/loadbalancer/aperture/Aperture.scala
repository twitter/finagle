/**
 * The aperture distributor balances load onto a window, the aperture, of
 * underlying capacity. The distributor exposes a control mechanism so that a
 * controller can adjust the aperture according to load conditions.
 *
 * The window contains a number of discrete serving units, one for each
 * node. No load metric is prescribed: this can be mixed in separately.
 *
 * The underlying nodes are arranged in a consistent fashion: an
 * aperture of a given size always refers to the same set of nodes; a
 * smaller aperture to a subset of those nodes so long as the nodes are of
 * equal `status` (i.e. unhealthy nodes are de-prioritized). Thus, it is
 * relatively harmless to adjust apertures frequently, since underlying nodes
 * are typically backed by pools, and will be warm on average.
