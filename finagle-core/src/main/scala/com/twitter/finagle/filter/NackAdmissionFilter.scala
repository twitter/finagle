/**
 * This filter probabilistically drops requests if the nack rate exceeds the
 * `nackRateThreshold`. In the case that most or all of the cluster which the
 * client is speaking to is overloaded, this will help the cluster cool off.
 *
 * The implementation of this filter is heavily inspired by Chapter 21, section
 * "Client-Side Throttling" of O'Reilly's "Site Reliability Engineering: How
 * Google Runs Production Systems", by Beyer, Jones, Petoff, and Murphy, 1e.
 *
 * NOTE: Here is a brief summary of the configurable params.
 *
 * A configuration with a `nackRateThreshold` of N% and a `window` of duration
 * W roughly translates as, "start dropping some requests to the cluster when
 * the nack rate averages at least N% over a window of duration W."
 *
 * Here are some examples of situations with param values chosen to make the
 * filter useful:
 *
 * - Owners of Service A examine their service's nack rate over several days
 *   and find that it is almost always under 10% and rarely above 1% (e.g.,
 *   during traffic spikes) or 5% (e.g., during a data center outage). They
 *   do not want to preemptively drop requests unless the cluster sees an
 *   extreme overload situation so they choose a nack rate threshold of 20%.
 *   And in such a situation they want the filter to act relatively quickly,
 *   so they choose a window of 30 seconds.
 *
 * - Owners of Service B observe that excess load typically causes peak nack
 *   rates of around 25% for up to 60 seconds. They want to be aggressive
 *   about avoiding cluster overload and donâ€™t mind dropping some innocent
 *   requests during mild load so they choose a window of 10 seconds and a
 *   threshold of 0.15 (= 15%).
 *
 * @param window Size of moving window for exponential moving average, which is
 * used to keep track of the ratio of nacked responses to accepted responses
 * and compute the client's accept rate. E.g., if set to 1 second, then only
 * requests occurring over the previous second will be used to calculate the
 * EMA. The window size influences how the EMA behaves in roughly the following
 * ways:
 *
 * - an EMA with a shorter window duration will respond more quickly to changes
 * in cluster performance, but will keep a less accurate estimate of the
 * long-term average accept rate;
 *
 * - an EMA with a longer window duration will respond more slowly to changes
 * in cluster performance, but will keep a more accurate estimate of the long-
 * term average accept rate.
 *
 * @param nackRateThreshold Constant which determines how aggressively the
 * filter drops requests. For example, if set to 1/2, then the highest nack
 * rate the filter will tolerate before probabilistically dropping requests is
 * 50%; if set to 1/3, then the highest nack rate tolerated is 33.3%. In
 * general, if set to x, the highest nack rate tolerated is x.
 *
 * @param random Random number generator used in probability calculation.
