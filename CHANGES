-----

Runtime Behavior Changes
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

  * finagle-core: DeadlineFilter is now per-connection, so the max rejection percentage
    is not shared across clients. This prevents a single client from exceeding the rejection
    budget. ``RB_ID=813731``.

  * finagle-http: Local Dtabs are now encoded into the `Dtab-Local` header.  `X-Dtab` headers
    may still be read but should be considered deprecated. ``RB_ID=815092``

Breaking API Changes
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

  * finagle-core: DefaultClient has been removed. Implementors should prefer `c.t.f.StackClient`
  ``RB_ID=812681``.

  * finagle-core: When a client is created, its server set resolution is started eagerly.
  ``RB_ID=806940``

  * finagle-core: Dentry now takes a Dentry.Prefix instead of a Path. ``RB_ID=813914``

  * finagle-cache-resolver: `c.t.f.cacheresolver.ZookeeperCacheNodeGroup` has been removed from the
    API since we no longer check for the zookeeper data for the cache pool size to refresh for the
    changes in the serverset. ``RB_ID=811190``

New Features
~~~~~~~~~~~~

  * finagle-core: Multi-line Dtabs may now contain line-oriented comments beginning with '#'.
    Comments are omitted from parsed Dtabs.

  * finagle-http: new stack params MaxChunkSize, MaxHeaderSize, and MaxInitialLineLength
    are available to configure the http codec. ``RB_ID=811129``

  * finagle-mux: Mux now has support for fragmenting Tdispatch and Rdispatch payloads.
    This helps with head-of-line blocking in the presence of large payloads and allows
    long transmissions to be interrupted. ``RB_ID=794641``.

  * finagle-core: Dtabs allow wildcard path elements in prefixes. ``RB_ID=813914``

Bug Fixes
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

  * finagle-http: Ensure that service closure is delayed until chunked response bodies
    have been processed. ``RB_ID=813110``

6.34.0
------

Runtime Behavior Changes
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

  * finagle-core: GenSerialClientDispatcher fails pending and subsequent requests when
    its underlying transport closes. ``RB_ID=807590``

New Features
~~~~~~~~~~~~

  * finagle-core: Include upstream/downstream addresses/client ids and request trace id
    in exceptions that extend `c.t.f.HasRemoteInfo` (including `c.t.f.SourcedException`),
    accessible via the `remoteInfo` value. ``RB_ID=797082``

  * finagle-core: Introduce `c.t.f.service.ResponseClassifier` for HTTP servers,
    which allows developers to give Finagle the additional application specific knowledge
    necessary in order to properly classify responses.``RB_ID=800179``

  * finagle: Export two new histograms: `request_payload_bytes` and `response_payload_bytes`
    for the following protocols: HTTP (non-chunked), Mux, ThriftMux and Thrift. ``RB_ID=797821``

  * finagle-core: Define `c.t.f.Address` to represent an endpoint's physical location.
    Resolvers and namers may attach metadata such as weight to individual endpoint addresses.
    ``RB_ID=792209``

  * finagle-http: Introduce convenience extractors to pattern match `c.t.f.http.Response.status`
    against the different categories. ``RB_ID=802953``

  * finagle-http: Add `toBoolean` method in `StringUtil` to parse strings to boolean consistently.
    ``RB_ID=804056``

  * finagle-http: Servers now actually decompress requests when decompression is turned on.
    ``RB_ID=810629``

  * finagle-redis: Add support for SENTINEL commands. ``RB_ID=810663``

  * finagle-redis: Support for Pub/Sub. ``RB_ID=810610``

Breaking API Changes
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

  * finagle-core: `c.t.f.Codec.prepareConnFactory(ServiceFactory)` is marked `final`, override
    `c.t.f.Codec.prepareConnFactory(ServiceFactory, Stack.Params)` instead. ``RB_ID=797821``

  * finagle-core: `c.t.f.Codec.newClientDispatcher(Transport)` is marked `final`, override
    `c.t.f.Codec.newClientDispatcher(Transport, Stack.Params)` instead. ``RB_ID=797821``

  * finagle-core: Removed deprecations: ``RB_ID=800974``
    - Removed `c.t.f.Service.release`, replace usage with `Service.close()`.
    - Removed `c.t.f.ServiceFactory.make`, replace usage with `ServiceFactory.apply`.
    - Removed `c.t.f.ProxyServiceFactory`, replace usage with `ServiceFactoryProxy`.
    - Removed deprecated `c.t.f.service.FailureAccrualFactory` constructor.
    - Removed `c.t.f.netty3.ChannelBufferBuf.apply`, replace usage with `ChannelBufferBuf.Owned.apply`.
    - Removed `c.t.f.util.InetAddressUtil.Loopback`, replace usage with `java.net.InetAddress.getLoopbackAddress`.
    - Removed `c.t.f.tracing.TracingFilter`, replace usage with `TraceInitializationFilter` and `(Client|Server)TracingFilter`.

  * finagle-core: `c.t.f.Addr.Bound.addr` type changed from `Set[SocketAddress]` to
    `Set[c.t.f.Address]`. We provide a migration guide below for the most common cases.

    Callers of `c.t.f.Addr.Bound.addr` must handle `Set[c.t.f.Address]` instead of
    `Set[SocketAddresses]`. If you do something with the `SocketAddress` and expect the underlying
    type to be `InetSocketAddress`, use `c.t.f.Address.Inet.addr` to get the underlying
    `InetSocketAddress`.

    `c.t.f.Addr` constructors and `c.t.f.Name.bound` method now accept `c.t.f.Address` instead
    of `SocketAddress`. For most cases, wrapping the `InetSocketAddress` in an `Address.Inet`
    will fix the compile error.

    Any other `SocketAddress` subclass is currently incompatible with `c.t.f.Address`. Instead,
    you should encode any additional information in the metadata field of `c.t.f.Address.Inet`
    or `c.t.f.exp.Address.ServiceFactory`. ``RB_ID=792209``

  * finagle-core: Delete `c.t.f.ServiceFactorySocketAddress` and replace usages with
    `c.t.f.exp.Address.ServiceFactory`. ``RB_ID=792209``

  * finagle-core: Delete `c.t.f.WeightedSocketAddress` and instead use
    `c.t.f.addr.WeightedAddress` to represent address weights. ``RB_ID=792209``

  * finagle-core: `c.t.f.builder.ClientBuilder.hosts` takes a Seq of `InetSocketAddress` instead of
    `SocketAddress`. If you get a compile error, change the static type to `InetSocketAddress` if
    you can. Otherwise, cast it at runtime to `InetSocketAddress`. ``RB_ID=792209``

  * finagle-core: `c.t.f.client.Transporter.EndpointAddr` takes a `c.t.f.Address` as its
    parameter instead of `SocketAddress`. ``RB_ID=792209``

  * finagle-core: `c.t.f.service.FauilureAccrualFactory.Param(FailureAccrualPolicy)` is removed -
    it's not safe to configure Failure Accrual with a shareable instance of the policy, use
    `() => FailureAccrualPolicy` instead. ``RB_ID=802953``

  * finagle-core: `$Client.withSessionQualifier.failureAccrualPolicy` has been removed from the API
    since it enables an experimental feature (use Stack's `.configured` API instead). ``RB_ID=802953``

  * finagle-core: `c.t.f.service.exp.FailureAccrualPolicies` (Java-friendly API) has been removed -
    use `c.t.f.service.exp.FailureAccrualPolicy` instead.

  * finagle-core: DefaultServer is removed. Protocol implementors should use StackServer instead.
  ``RB_ID=811918``

  * finagle-memcached: `c.t.f.memcached.protocol.text.Memcached` no longer takes a `StatsReceiver`,
    pass it to a `(Client/Server)Builder` instead. ``RB_ID=797821``

  * finagle-redis: `c.t.f.redis.Redis` no longer takes a `StatsReceiver`, pass it to a
    `(Client/Server)Builder` instead. ``RB_ID=797821``

  * finagle-core: `c.t.f.http.MapHeaderMap` no longer takes a `mutable.Map[String, Seq[String]]` as
    a constructor parameter. `apply` method provides a similar functionality.

Bug Fixes
~~~~~~~~~

  * finagle-core: Fixed `getAll` method on `c.t.f.http.MapHeaderMap`, now it is case insensitive.
    `apply` method was altering the provided header names. This is fixed it is now possible to
    iterate on the original header names.

6.33.0
------

New Features
~~~~~~~~~~~~

  * finagle-core: Introduce the `c.t.f.service.PendingRequestFactory` module in the client Stack.
    The module allows clients to limit the number of pending requests per connection. It is disabled
    by default. ``RB_ID=795491``

  * finagle-core: Introduce the `c.t.f.filter.ServerAdmissionControl` module in the server Stack,
    which is enabled through the param `c.t.f.param.EnableServerAdmissionControl`. Users can define
    their own admission control filters, which reject requests when the server operates beyond
    its capacity. These rejections apply backpressure and allow clients to retry requests on
    servers that may not be over capacity. The filter implementation should define its own logic
    to determine over capacity. One or more admission control filters can be installed through
    the `ServerAdmissionControl.register` method. ``RB_ID=776385``

  * finagle-core: Introduce `c.t.f.service.ResponseClassifier` which allows developers to
    give Finagle the additional application specific knowledge necessary in order to properly
    classify them. Without this, Finagle can only safely make judgements about transport
    level failures. This is now used by `StatsFilter` and `FailureAccrualFactory` so that
    application level failures can be used for both success metrics and failure accrual.
    ``RB_ID=772906``

  * finagle-core: Added a new 'Endpoints' section on client pages, listing the weights, paths,
    and resolved endpoints for each dtab.``RB_ID=779001``

  * finagle-core: Introduce discoverable stack params which are available on every client/server
    via the `with`-prefixed methods. ``RB_ID=781833``

  * finagle-memcached: Added `c.t.f.memcached.BaseClient.checkAndSet` which exposes the difference
    between a conflict and a not found result.

  * finagle-mux: Add a Wireshark dissector that can decode Mux messages. ``RB_ID=779482``

  * finagle-stats: Define flag `c.t.f.stats.statsFilterFile` as GlobalFlag[Set[File]] to take
    comma-separated multiple files. ``RB_ID=793397``

  * finagle-mux: Tinit/Rinit are now available and permit feature negotiation. ``RB_ID=793350``

Deprecations
~~~~~~~~~~~~

  * finagle-memcached: `c.t.f.memcached.BaseClient.cas` is deprecated in favor of the richer
    `checkAndSet` method.

Breaking API Changes
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

  * finagle-core: All the deprecated exceptions from `Exceptions.scala` have been removed.
    ``RB_ID=774658``
  * finagle-thrift: Remove the `framed` attributes from `c.t.f.Thrift.Client` and
    `c.t.f.Thrift.Server`.  This behavior may now be controlled with `c.t.f.Thrift.param.Framed`.
  * finagle-core: Unused `c.t.f.builder.NonShrinkingCluster` has been removed.
    ``RB_ID=779001``

  * finagle-thrift: `c.t.f.ThriftRichClient` has a new abstract protected method
    `responseClassifier: ResponseClassifier`. If your implementation does not need
    this, you can implement it with `ResponseClassifier.Default`. ``RB_ID=791470``

Runtime Behavior Changes
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

  * finagle-thrift,thriftmux: Deserialization of Thrift responses now happens as part
    of service application which means that it will now be part of the latency reported by
    `StatsFilter`. The actual latency as perceived by clients will not have changed, but
    for clients that spend significant time deserializing and do not have higher level
    metrics this may come as a surprise. ``RB_ID=772931``

  * finagle-mux,thriftmux: The default `closeTimeout` in ping based failure detection
    is changed from Duration.Top to 4 seconds, to allow a session to be closed by default
    when a ping response times out after 4 seconds. This allows sessions to be reestablished
    when there may be a networking issue, so that it can choose an alternative networking
    path instead. ``RB_ID=773649``

Breaking API Changes
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

  * finagle-thrift: Remove the `framed` attributes from `c.t.f.Thrift.Client` and
    `c.t.f.Thrift.Server`.  This behavior may now be controlled with `c.t.f.Thrift.param.Framed`.

6.32.0

NOT RELEASED

6.31.0
------

New Features
~~~~~~~~~~~~

  * finagle-core: `c.t.f.Server` now has a `serveAndAnnounce` method that accepts a `SocketAddress`
    as an address. ``RB_ID=758862``

  * finagle-core: `c.t.f.service.Retries` now supports adding delay between each automatic retry.
    This is configured via the `Retries.Budget`. ``RB_ID=768883``

  * finagle-core: FailureAccrualFactory now uses a FailureAccrualPolicy to determine when to
    mark an endpoint dead. The default policy, FailureAccrualPolicy.consecutiveFailures(),
    mimicks existing functionality, and FailureAccrualPolicy.successRate() operates on the
    exponentially weighted average success rate over a window of requests.``RB_ID=756921``

  * finagle-core: Introduce `c.t.f.transport.Transport.Options` to configure transport-level options
    (i.e., socket options `TCP_NODELAY` and `SO_REUSEADDR`). ``RB_ID=773824``

  * finagle-http: `c.t.f.http.exp.Multipart` now supports both in-memory and on-disk file uploads.
    ``RB_ID=RB_ID=769889``

  * finagle-netty4: Hello World. Introduce a `Listener` for Netty 4.1. This is still considered beta.
    ``RB_ID=718688``

  * finagle-netty4: Introduce `ChannelTransport` for Netty 4.1. ``RB_ID=763435``

  * finagle-thrift: `c.t.f.ThriftRichClient` implementations of `newServiceIface`
    method that accept a `label` argument to pass to the `ScopedStats` instance. ``RB_ID=760157``

  * finagle-stats: Added `c.t.f.stats` now has a `statsFilterFile` flag which will read a blacklist
    of regex, newline-separated values. It will be used along with the `statsFilter` flag for stats
    filtering. ``RB_ID=764914``

Deprecations
~~~~~~~~~~~~

  * finagle-core: the #channelFactory method of `c.t.f.builder.ServerBuilder` has been deprecated
    in favor of the `c.t.f.netty3.numWorkers` flag. ``RB_ID=718688``

Runtime Behavior Changes
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

  * finagle-core: The behavior for `c.t.f.util.DefaultMonitor` has changed such that
    unhandled exceptions are propagated to `c.t.u.RootMonitor` except for
    `c.t.f.Failures` with a log `Level` below INFO. ``RB_ID=758056``

  * finagle-core: The metrics for requeues `requeue/requeues`, `requeue/budget` and
    `requeue/budget_exhausted` have moved under retries. They are now `retries/requeues`,
    `retries/budget` and `retries/budget_exhausted`. ``RB_ID=760213``

  * finagle-core: `c.t.f.service.RetryFilter` and `c.t.f.service.RetryExceptionsFilter`
    now default to using a `RetryBudget` to mitigate retry amplification on downstream
    services. The previous behavior can be achieved by explicitly passing in
    `RetryBudget.Infinite`. ``RB_ID=766302``

  * finagle-core: `c.t.f.factory.TrafficDistributor` now suppresses changes when a bound
    address is updated from a valid set to an error. Instead, it continues using stale
    data until it gets a successful update.

  * finagle-http: Unhandled exceptions from user defined HTTP services are now converted
    into very basic 500 responses so clients talking to those services see standard HTTP
    responses instead of a dropped connection. ``RB_ID=755846``

  * finagle-memcached: Moved metrics from underlying `KetamaPartitionedClient` for Memcached clients
    to share the same scope of the underlying finagle client. ``RB_ID=771691``

  * finagle-mux: `com.twitter.finagle.mux.ThresholdFailureDetector` is turned on by
    default. ``RB_ID=756213``

  * finagle-serversets: The `c.t.f.serverset2.Zk2Resolver` now surfaces `Addr.Pending`
    when it detects that its underlying ZooKeeper client is unhealthy. Unhealthy is defined
    as non-connected for greater than its 'unhealthyWindow' (which defaults to 5 minutes).
    ``RB_ID=760771``

  * finagle-serversets: The `c.t.f.serverset2.ZkSession` now uses an unbounded semaphore to
    limit to 100 outstanding zookeeper requests at any one moment. ``RB_ID=771399``


Breaking API Changes
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

  * finagle-core: `BackupRequestLost` is no longer itself an `Exception`. Use
    `BackupRequestLost.Exception` in its place. ``RB_ID=758056``

  * finagle-core: Replaced `c.t.f.builder.ClientConfig.Retries` with
    `c.t.f.service.Retries.Policy`. ``RB_ID=760213``

  * finagle-core: A deprecated `c.t.f.CancelledReadException` has been removed.
    ``RB=763435``

  * finagle-http: `c.t.f.http.exp.Multipart.decodeNonChunked` has been removed from
    the public API. Use `c.t.f.http.Request.multipart` instead. Also
    `c.t.f.http.exp.Multipart.FileUpload` is no longer a case class, but base trait
    for `Multipart.InMemoryFileUpload` and `Multipart.OnDiskFileUpload`. ``RB_ID=769889``

  * finagle-mux: `c.t.f.FailureDetector.apply` method is changed to private scope,
    to reduce API surface area. Using `FailureDetector.Config` is enough to config
    session based failure detection behavior. ``RB_ID=756833``

  * finagle-mux: `closeThreshold` in `c.t.f.mux.FailureDetector.ThresholdConfig` is
    changed to `closeTimeout`, from an integer that was used as a multiplier to time
    duration. This makes it easier to config. ``RB_ID=759406``

Bug Fixes
~~~~~~~~~

  * finagle-thrift: `c.t.f.ThriftRichClient` scoped stats label is now threaded
    properly through `newServiceIface` ``RB_ID=760157``

6.30.0
------

New Features
~~~~~~~~~~~~

  * finagle-core: `com.twitter.finagle.client.LatencyCompensator` allows its
    default Compensator value to be set via an API call. This allows
    libraries to set defaults for clients that have not configured this module.
    ``RB_ID=750228``

  * finagle-core: New Resolver `com.twitter.finagle.FixedInetResolver` extends
    InetResolver by caching successful DNS lookups indefinitely. It's scheme is 'fixedinet'.
    This is used by clients or resolvers that do not want or expect
    host->ip map changes (such as the zk2 resolver and twemcache client).
    ``RB_ID=753712``

Runtime Behavior Changes
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

  * finagle-core: `RetryPolicy.tries` now uses jittered backoffs instead of
    having no delay. ``RB_ID=752629``

  * finagle-core: `FailureAccrualFactory` uses jittered backoffs as the duration
    to mark dead for, if `markDeadFor` is not configured. ``RB_ID=746930``

  * finagle-core: The transit latency (transit_latency_ms) and deadline budget
    (deadline_budget_ms) stats are now only recorded for servers, not for
    clients anymore, since they're only meaningful for servers. ``RB_ID=75268``

  * finagle-http: Clients sending requests with payloads larger than the server
    accepts (default 5MB) now receive a HTTP 413 response instead of a channel
    closed exception.  ``RB_ID=753664``

Breaking API Changes
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

  * finagle-core: `TimerFromNettyTimer` is renamed to `HashedWheelTimer` and
    the constructor accepting `org.jboss.netty.util.Timer` made private. For
    compatibility, `HashedWheelTimer` has additional constructors to match
    those provided by `org.jboss.netty.util.HashedWheelTimer`. ``RB_ID=748514``

  * finagle-httpx / finagle-httpx-compat: Renamed to finagle-http and
    finagle-http-compat respectively. This changes the package names, e.g.:
    com.twitter.finagle.httpx to com.twitter.finagle.http. ``RB_ID=751876``

  * finagle-core: Marked `HandletimeFilter` private[finagle], and renamed it to
    `ServerStatsFilter`. ``RB_ID=75268``

  * finagle-zipkin: Drop `c.t.zipkin.thrift.Annotation.duration` and associated thrift field
    `c.t.f.thrift.thrift.Annotation.duration`. ``RB_ID=751986``

  * finagle-stress: Project has been removed from Finagle. ``RB_ID=752201``

  * finagle-swift: Project has been moved off of Finagle to
    https://github.com/finagle/finagle-swift . ``RB_ID=752826``

6.29.0
------

Deprecations
~~~~~~~~~~~~

  * finagle-http: Deprecated in favour of finagle-httpx and now removed.

New Features
~~~~~~~~~~~~

  * finagle-core: Provides a `RetryFilter` which takes a
    `RetryPolicy[(Req, Try[Rep])]` and allows you to retry on both "successful"
    requests, such as HTTP 500s, as well as failed requests. The `Req`
    parameterization facilitates using the request to determine if retrying is
    safe (i.e. the request is idempotent).

  * finagle-httpx: Experimental support `multipart/form-data` (file uploads)
    decoding via `c.t.f.httpx.exp.Multipart`. ``RB_ID=730102``

Runtime Behavior Changes
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

  * finagle-core: `InetResolver.bind` will now succeed if any hostname resolution
    succeeds. Previous behavior required that all hosts are successfully resolved.
    ``RB_ID=737748``

  * finagle-core: DNS lookups in InetResolver are no longer cached
    within Finagle according to `networkaddress.cache.ttl`; we rely
    instead on however caching is configured in the JVM and OS. ``RB_ID=735006``

  * finagle-core: After being revived, a `FailureAccrualFactory` enters a
    'probing' state wherein it must successfully satisfy a request before
    accepting more. If the request fails, it waits for the next `markDeadFor`
    period. ``RB_ID=747541``

  * finagle-serversets: DNS lookups in Zk2Resolver are no longer
    cached within Finagle according to `networkaddress.cache.ttl`;
    instead they are cached indefinitely. ``RB_ID=735006``

  * finagle-redis: c.t.f.Redis now uses a pipelined dispatcher along with
    a concurrent load balancer to help eliminate head-of-line blocking.

Breaking API Changes
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

  * finagle-core: `RetryingFilter`, which takes a RetryPolicy[Try[Nothing]]` and
    is invoked only on exceptions, has been renamed to `RetryExceptionsFilter`.
    `RetryExceptionsFilter` is a subclass of `RetryFilter`, which takes a
    `RetryPolicy[(Req, Try[Rep])]` and allows you to retry on both "successful"
    requests, such as HTTP 500s, as well as failed requests. The `Req`
    parameterization facilitates using the request to determine if retrying is
    safe (i.e. the request is idempotent).

  * finagle-core: Name.all is now private to `com.twitter.finagle`.

  * finagle-memcached: Unified stack-based construction APIs and cleanup internal
    constructors. In particular, `KetamaClient` was removed and `KetamaPartitionClient`
    and `KetamaFailureAccrualFactory` are now sealed inside Finagle. See
    [[com.twitter.finagle.Memcached]] for how to construct a finagle-memcached client.

  * finagle-redis: Port the c.t.f.Redis protocol object to the StackClient API.
    A redis client can now be constructed and configured like the rest of the
    finagle subprojects.

6.28.0
------

New Features
~~~~~~~~~~~~

Runtime Behavior Changes
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

  * finagle-core: Weights are no longer supported by the load balancers. They are moved
    one level above and interpreted by a new module, the `TrafficDistributor`. This
    frees the balancers to have non-linear load metrics. It also changes the semantics
    of weights. They are now normalized by size of endpoints that share the same weight
    and interpreted proportional to offered load (however, they can still be though of,
    roughly, as multipliers for traffic). ``RB_ID=677416``

  * finagle-core: The RequestSemaphoreFilter now sheds load by dropping the tail of the queue
    and failing it with a `Failure.Restartable`. Previously, the filter had an unbounded
    queue but now the default size is 0 (i.e. no queueing). The dropped requests are in
    turn requeued by Finagle clients with protocol support (e.g. Http, ThriftMux).
    ``RB_ID=696934``

  * finagle-core: `ServerBuilder.ServerConfig.BindTo`, `ServerBuilder.ServerConfig.MonitorFactory`,
    and `ServerBuilder.ServerConfig.Daemonize`, are now private to `com.twitter.finagle.builder`. ``RB_ID=730865``

  * finagle-memcachedx: Renamed to finagle-memcached.

  * finagle-stats: Standard deviation ("$statName.stddev") is no longer exported.
    ``RB_ID=726309`` (follow up to ``RB_ID=717647``)

  * finagle-serversets: `namer/bind_latency_us` stat now counts only
    time in name resolution, not service acquisition.
    `namer/{dtabcache,namecache,nametreecache}/misstime_ms` stats are
    no longer exported. ``RB_ID=730309``

Breaking API Changes
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

  * finagle-core: `c.t.f.jsr166y` has been replaced with Java 7 API. finagle: Replace JSR166y
    with Java 7 API. ``RB_ID=720903``

  * finagle-core: `LoadBalancerFactory` no longer takes endpoints with weights as
    per the decoupling mentioned in runtime changes. ``RB_ID=677416``

  * finagle-core: `RequestSemaphoreFilter.Param` now accepts a `com.twitter.concurrent.AsyncSemaphore`
    instead of an integer representing the max concurrency. ``RB_ID=696934``

  * finagle-core: removed `c.t.f.asyncDns` flag and `c.t.f.SyncInetResolver`; DNS resolution is
    now always asynchronous. ``RB_ID=734427``

  * finagle-core: `ClientBuilder.ClientConfig.DefaultParams`, `ClientBuilder.ClientConfig.DestName`,
    `ClientBuilder.ClientConfig.GlobalTimeout`, `ClientBuilder.ClientConfig.Daemonize`, and
    `ClientBuilder.ClientConfig.MonitorFactory` are now private to `com.twitter.finagle.builder`.
    `ClientBuilder.ClientConfig.Retries` is now private to `com.twitter`. ``RB_ID=727245``

  * finagle-httpx: `Method` no longer has an extractor. To access the name of
    custom methods, use `toString`. ``RB_ID=722913``

  * finagle-mux: `c.t.f.mux.exp.FailureDetector` and `c.t.f.mux.exp.sessionFailureDetector` are
    moved out of exp package into mux package. ``RB_ID=725350``

6.27.0
------

New Features
~~~~~~~~~~~~

  * finagle-http: Support nacks between Finagle Http clients and servers. When a server fails
    with retryable exceptions (exceptions wrapped by `Failure.rejected`), it sends back a "Nack"
    response, i.e. 503 Response code with a new "finagle-http-nack" header. This allows clients
    to safely retry failed requests, and keep connections open. ``RB_ID=705948``

Runtime Behavior Changes
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

  * finagle-core: FailFast parameter renamed from `onOrOff` to `enabled`. ``RB_ID=720781``

  * finagle-core: When evaluating NameTree unions, return components of the union in Ok state rather
    than waiting for all components to be Ok. This enables resilience of unions when part of the
    tree cannot be resolved. ``RB_ID=697114``

  * finagle-stats: Standard of deviation is no longer calculated. It is exported as a constant 0.0
    for "$statName.stddev". ``RB_ID=717647``

Breaking API Changes
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
  * finagle-stream: Introduce StreamRequest as a replacement for Netty's
    HttpRequest, and converted the rest of the public API to not leak
    other Netty types (notably ChannelBuffer is replaced by Buf). ``RB_ID=695896``

  * finagle-core: Dtab does not implement the Namer interface anymore. Use
    `c.t.f.naming.DefaultInterpreter` to bind a name via a Dtab. Support for Dtab entries starting
    with /#/ has been removed. `c.t.f.Namer.bindAndEval` has been removed. Use
    `c.t.f.Namer.resolve` instead. ``RB_ID=711681``

  * finagle: `LoadService` and `ThriftRichClient` migrated off of deprecated `ClassManifest`
    to `ClassTag`. ``RB_ID=720455``

6.26.0
-------

Deprecations
~~~~~~~~~~~~

  * finagle-memcached: Deprecated in favor of finagle-memcachedx and now removed.

New Features
~~~~~~~~~~~~

  * finagle-httpx: Support nacks between Finagle Http clients and servers. When a server fails
    with retryable exceptions (exceptions wrapped by `Failure.rejected`), it sends back a "Nack"
    response, i.e. 503 Response code with a new "finagle-http-nack" header. This allows clients
    to safely retry failed requests, and keep connections open. ``RB_ID=670046``

Breaking API Changes
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
  * finagle-core: Moved netty3 specific things into a netty3 namespace. For
    these symbols, the namespace translation follows this pattern:
    `c.t.f.$MODULE._ => c.t.f.netty3.$MODULE._.` ``RB_ID=691746``

  * finagle-core: Define `WeightedSocketAddress` as a case class. Add
    `WeightedSocketAddress.extract` method to extract weight. ``RB_ID=614228``

  * finagle-core: Constructing a new Balancer that can be injected into a Finagle client
    was unnecessarily complex and non-uniform. We removed the legacy constructors around
    defining the collection of endpoints and simplified the interface to `LoadBalancerFactory`.
    Now, `com.twitter.finagle.loadbalancer.Balancers` defines the collection of balancer
    constructors. ``RB_ID=660730``

  * finagle-core: Aperture can no longer be enabled via command line flags. Configuring
    per-client settings globally is generally not a good idea and we're working to remove
    these flags from Finagle. Use the constructors in `com.twitter.finagle.loadbalancer.Balancers`
    to create an instance that can be injected into a client. ``RB_ID=663194``

  * finagle-core: The default load balancer has changed to p2c from heap. ``RB_ID=693450``

  * finagle-core: `Service.isAvailable` and `ServiceFactory.isAvailable` is finalized.
    `Service.status` and `ServiceFactory.status` supersedes `isAvailable` usage since 6.24.0 release.
    ``RB_ID=678588``

  * finagle-core: `ClientBuilder.failureAccrual` method is removed. Use `ClientBuilder.failureAccrualFactory`
    instead. ``RB_ID=689076``

  * finagle-core: Stack param `ClientBuilder.ClientConfig.FailureAccrualFac` is removed.
    Use `ClientBuilder.failureAccrualFactory` instead. ``RB_ID=689076``

  * finagle-exception: `com.twitter.finagle.exception.ExceptionReporter` is no longer used
    as the default `com.twitter.finagle.util.ReporterFactory`. ``RB_ID=674646``

  * finagle-kestrel: Replace deprecated finagle-kestrel package with finagle-kestrelx.
    ``RB_ID=667920``

  * finagle-core: Add new method `noFailureAccrual` on `ClientBuilder` that completely disables
    `FailureAccrualFactory` in the underlying stack. ``RB_ID=689076``

New Features
~~~~~~~~~~~~

- finagle-thrift: Support for finagle Services per thrift method.

6.25.0
------

Breaking API Changes
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

  * finagle-core: `c.t.f.builder.Server` now implements `c.t.f.ListeningServer`.

  * finagle-core: `c.t.f.Server.serveAndAnnounce` with a `ServiceFactory` had
    its first argument renamed to `name` from `forum`.

  * finagle-core: Add an attribute map to `c.t.f.Addr.Bound`.

  * finagle-core: `c.t.f.builder.ClientConfig.FailFast` has moved to
    `c.t.f.FailFastFactory.FailFast`.

  * finagle-core: NoBrokersAvailableException now has two Dtab constructor
    arguments, both the base and local Dtabs.

  * finagle-core: `c.t.f.Failure` convenience constructors (e.g., `Failure.Cause`,
    `Failure.Rejected`) were removed in favor of uniform flag treatment, and clean
    separation of attributes from interpretation of those attributes.

  * finagle-core: `ExitGuard` usage is now private to finagle.

  * finagle-core: `c.t.f.service.TimeoutFilter.module` is now split into
    `TimeoutFilter.clientModule` and `TimeoutFilter.serverModule`.

  * finagle-core: remove deprecated `c.t.f.builder.ClientBuilder.stack` taking a
    `Stack.Params => Client[Req1, Rep1]`.

  * finagle-core: StackRegistry.Entry takes different constructor arguments, and the
    name has been bundled in with the Stack.Params.  StackRegistry.Entry is only used
    internally, so this should be relatively inexpensive.  Similarly, StackRegister#register
    has also had a small change to its method signature along the same lines.

  * finagle-http: deprecated methods in `c.t.f.http.HttpMessageProxy` have been removed.

  * finagle-memcached / finagle-memcachedx: move TwitterCacheResolver
    and related objects to new finagle-cacheresolver package.

  * finagle-memcached / finagle-memcachedx: failureAccrual param in ReplicationClient
    is changed from type (Int, Duration) to (Int, () => Duration), to allow flexibility
    to config duration. Also see `markDeadFor` change in finagle-core in the "New Features"
    section below.

  * finagle-memcached / finagle-memcachedx: MigrationClientTest now uses
    ServerCnxnFactory from com.twitter.zk rather than NIOServerCnxn.Factory from
    org.apache.zookeeper.server.

  * finagle-mux: `c.t.f.mux.RequestNackedException` is removed in favor of a standard
    Failure (`c.t.f.Failure.Rejected`).

  * finagle-ostrich4: Switched dependency to finagle-httpx from finagle-http.

  * finagle-serversets: ZkInstance in tests now uses ServerCnxnFactory from
    com.twitter.zk rather than NIOServerCnxn.Factory from
    org.apache.zookeeper.server.

  * finagle-stats: Switched dependency to finagle-httpx from finagle-http.

  * finagle-mysql: PreparedStatements are now more type-safe! The type signature of
    PreparedStatements has changed from Seq[Any] => Future[Result] to Seq[Parameter] =>
    Future[Result]. Parameter represents objects that are serializable by finagle-mysql.
    In most cases, scalac should transparently wrap your arguments in Parameter when
    applying a PreparedStatement. However, in cases where this doesn't happen you
    can explicitly wrap them using `Parameter.wrap`.

Runtime Behavior Changes
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

  * finagle-core: `com.twitter.finagle.service.StatsFilter` no longer requires a
    `com.twitter.finagle.stats.RollupStatsReceiver` for correct behaviour, and
    providing one will double count failures.

  * finagle-core: `com.twitter.finagle.factory.TimeoutFactory` will fail with
    a retryable `com.twitter.finagle.Failure` when it times out.

  * finagle-core: `com.twitter.finagle.pool.WatermarkPool` will fail with
    an interrupted `com.twitter.finagle.Failure` when it is interrupted while
    waiting or trying to establish a connection.  It has previously failed with
    a `com.twitter.finagle.WriteException` when trying to establish a
    connection, but it's incorrect to retry on an interruption.

  * finagle-core: `com.twitter.fiangle.RetryPolicy`'s `RetryableWriteException`
    and `WriteExceptionsOnly` will not retry on `com.twitter.finagle.Failure`s
    that are marked `InterruptedBy`, even if they are `Retryable`.

  * finagle-core: The error message provided by `c.t.f.NoBrokersAvailableException`
    prints both the base and local Dtabs.

  * finagle-core: Stats produced by `com.twitter.finagle.factory.BindingFactory`
    are now scoped with the "namer" prefix rather than "interpreter". The total
    latency associated with Name binding is now recorded in the "bind_latency_ms"
    stat.

  * finagle-core: The "service_creation/service_acquisition_latency_ms" stat
    produced by `com.twitter.finagle.factory.StatsFactoryWrapper` no longer
    includes time spent in name resolution, which is now covered by
    "namer/bind_latency_us" as discussed above.

  * finagle-core: added transit_latency_ms and deadline_budget_ms stats.

  * finagle-core: Automatic retries (requeues) are now credited as a ratio of
    requests over a window of time, instead of a fixed limit. The stats scope
    has also changed from "automatic" to "requeues".

Deprecations
~~~~~~~~~~~~

  * finagle-core: `c.t.f.builder.Server.localAddress` is deprecated in favor of
    `c.t.f.ListeningServer.boundAddress`.

New Features
~~~~~~~~~~~~

  * finagle-core: `Fail fast <https://twitter.github.io/finagle/guide/FAQ.html#why-do-clients-see-com-twitter-finagle-failedfastexception-s>`_
    is now `configurable <https://twitter.github.io/finagle/guide/FAQ.html#configuring-finagle6>`_
    on Stack-based clients via the `com.twitter.finagle.FailFastFactory.FailFast` param.

  * finagle-core: `com.twitter.finagle.service.StatsFilter` is now configurable with an
    `com.twitter.finagle.stats.ExceptionStatsHandler` to customize how failures are recorded.

  * finagle-core: It should be safe to match on `com.twitter.finagle.Failure.InterruptedBy`
    to tell if a `com.twitter.util.Future` failed due to being interrupted.

  * finagle-core: `markDeadFor` in c.t.f.service.FailureAccrualFactory.Param is changed from
    Duration type to () => Duration. So it's flexible for clients to pass in a function that
    specifies Duration. For example, c.t.f.service.FailureAccrualFactory provides a function
    that adds perturbation in durations. Stack-based API and c.t.f.builder.ClientBuilder
    support both types for client configuration. For example,

    ::

      Thrift.client.configured(FailureAccrualFactory(5, () => 1.seconds))
      // or
      Thrift.client.configured(new FailureAccrualFactory(5, 1.seconds)).

    c.t.f.client.DefaultClient does not support Duration type in failureAccrual anymore.

  * finagle-core: improved Java compatiblity for `c.t.f.Stack.Params` / `c.t.f.Stack.Parameterized`.

  * finagle-core: Introduce the ability to add metadata to bound `com.twitter.finagle.Addr`\s.

  * finagle-core: Introduce per-address latency compensation.  Clients may be configured with
    a 'Compensator' function that uses the client's address metadata to adjust connection and
    request timeouts.  This can be used, for instance, to account for speed-of-light latency
    between physical regions.

  * finagle-core: Introduce per-address stats scoping.  Clients may be configured with
    a `com.twitter.finagle.client.StatsScoping.Scoper` function that uses the client's
    address metadata to adjust the scope of client stats. This can be used, for instance,
    to properly scope client stats for a Name that resolves to a Union of distinct clusters.

  * finagle-core: A convenient method `Client.newService(dest: String, label: String)` was added.

  * finagle-core: ExitGuard now has an 'explainGuards' method to provide a human-readable
    description of exit guards that are still active.

  * finagle-http(x): Two missing params were added: `Decompression` and `CompressionLevel`. Both
    client and server may be configured with either `configured` method or `withDecompression`/
    `withCompressionLevel`.

  * finagle-mysql: Add support for MySQL transactions.

  * finagle-stats: A new HostStatsReceiver type is added and used for per host stats.
    It is loaded through LoadService and used by the Stack-based API as a default
    param. Per host stats can be turned on through `com.twitter.finagle.loadbalancer.perHostStats`
    flag, and is exported to the "/admin/per_host_metrics.json" route in twitter-server.

  * finagle-stats: Improved compatibility when migrating from
    `Ostrich <https://github.com/twitter/ostrich/>`_ stats via two flags:
    ``com.twitter.finagle.stats.useCounterDeltas=true`` and
    ``com.twitter.finagle.stats.format=ostrich``. If these flags are both set,
    HTTP requests to ``/admin/stats.json`` with the ``period=60`` query string
    parameter will replicate Ostrich's behavior by computing deltas on counters
    every minute and formatting histograms with the same labels Ostrich uses.

  * finagle-memcached(x): Add `c.t.f.memcached.Memcached` which provides a Stack
    based Memcache client that uses pipelining.

Bug Fixes
~~~~~~~~~

  * finagle-core: `c.t.f.Server.serveAndAnnounce` for a `Service` had its usage
    of `name` and `addr` transposed.

Miscellaneous Cleanup
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

  * finagle-protobuf: Move entire unused subproject to the `Finagle
    organization on GitHub <https://github.com/finagle/finagle-protobuf>`_.


6.24.0
------

Breaking API Changes
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

  * finagle-core: Remove `c.t.f.client.StackClient.Role.loadBalancer`, which
    was unused and duplicated by `c.t.f.loadbalancer.LoadBalancerFactory.role`.

  * finagle-core: `c.t.f.Namer.orElse` was removed; composing Namers
    may be accomplished by constructing an appropriate Dtab.

  * finagle-core: removed experimental `enum` / `expand` from
    `c.t.f.Namer` and `alt` / `union` from `c.t.f.Dtab`.

  * finagle-http: Remove `c.t.f.http.CheckRequestFilter` along with
    `c.t.f.http.CheckHttpRequestFilter`. The functionality has been
    added to `c.t.f.http.codec.HttpServerDispatcher`. In addition,
    the codecError in `c.t.f.http.BadHttpRequest` has been replaced
    with the exception thrown by the HttpServerCodec.

  * finagle-httpx: Remove deprecated code, limited scope of access on internal
    classes.

  * finagle-mux: `c.t.f.mux.lease.exp.WindowedByteCounter` no longer
    calls `Thread.start()` in its constructor. This should be now be
    done by the caller.

  * finagle-mux: The experimental session API is discontinued.

  * finagle-mux: Introduce new Request and Response types for mux services.
    The new mux request includes a `destination` path so that, which corresponds
    to the `destination` field in Tdispatch requests. Furthermore, these new
    types expose `c.t.io.Buf` instead of Netty's ChannelBuffers.

  * finagle-thrift,finagle-thriftmux: `c.t.f.Thrift.Client`, `c.t.f.Thrift.Server`,
    `c.t.f.ThriftMux.Client` and `c.t.f.ThriftMux.Server` have their
    `TProtocolFactory` configured via a `c.t.f.thrift.param.ProtocolFactory`
    `Stack.Param`.

  * finagle-thriftmux: `c.t.f.ThriftMux.Client` now has its `ClientId`
    configured via a `c.t.f.thrift.param.ClientId` `Stack.Param`.


  * Traces (``com.twitter.finagle.tracing.Trace``) lose their local-state mutating methods:
    ``Trace.clear``, ``Trace.pushId``, ``Trace.setId``, ``Trace.setTerminalId``, ``Trace.pushTracer``,
    ``Trace.pushTracerAndSetNextId``,
    ``Trace.state_=``, and ``Trace.unwind``.
    Let-bound versions of these are introduced in their stead.
    This makes it simple to ensure that state changes are properly delimited;
    further, these are always guaranteed to be delimited properly by Finagle.

    ::

      Trace.setTracer(tracer)
      codeThatUsesTracer()

      // Let-bound version:
      Tracer.letTracer(tracer) {
        codeThatUsesTracer()
      }

  * Context handlers (``com.twitter.finagle.Context``) are removed.
    They are replaced by the use of marshalled request contexts
    (``com.twitter.finagle.context.Contexts.broadcast``).
    Marshalled request contexts do not require the use of service loading,
    so their use no longer requires build system coordination.
    We show Finagle's trace context:
    the first version uses the old context handler mechanism;
    the second uses ``Contexts.broadcast``.

    ::

      // The old context handler for Finagle's tracing context. Note that this
      // also required the file
      // finagle-core/src/main/resources/META-INF/services/com.twitter.finagle.ContextHandler
      // to contain the fully qualifed class path of the below object.
      class TraceContext extends ContextHandler {
        val key = Buf.Utf8("com.twitter.finagle.tracing.TraceContext")

        def handle(body: Buf) {
          // Parse 'body' and mutate the trace state accordingly.
        }

        def emit(): Option[Buf] = {
          // Read the trace state and marshal to a Buf.
        }
      }

      // New definition. No service loading required.
      private[finagle] val idCtx = new Contexts.broadcast.Key[TraceId] {
        val marshalId = Buf.Utf8("com.twitter.finagle.tracing.TraceContext")

        def marshal(id: TraceId): Buf = {
          // Marshal the given trace Id
        }

        def tryUnmarshal(body: Buf): Try[TraceId] = {
          // Try to marshal 'body' into a trace id.
        }
      }


Runtime Behavior Changes
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

  * finagle-mux: Mark the ServiceFactory available again if the underlying
    Service is no longer available.  This permits it to be closed and reused.

  * finagle-mux: Rename the "lease_counter" counter to "leased" on mux clients.

Deprecations
~~~~~~~~~~~~

 * finagle-core: Deprecated the mechanisms of FailureAccrual that use
   factory Transformers.  It's better to just use the Params to
   configure the existing FailureAccrualFactory.  However, if you've
   actually written your own failure accrual transformer that's
   significantly different, then you can do stack.replace() to swap it
   in.

 * finagle-memcached: Have cas() operation return false on NotFound()
   state instead of throw IllegalStateException

New Features
~~~~~~~~~~~~

  * finagle-core: All `Stack.Param`s used in `ClientBuilder` and
    `ServerBuilder` are now publicly exposed for configuration
    parity.

  * finagle-mux: Drain mux servers properly, so that shutdowns can be
    graceful.

  * finagle-core: Introduce `Service.status` which supersedes
    `Service.isAvailable`. `Service.status` is a fine-grained
    health indicator. The default definition of
    `Service.isAvailable` is now defined in terms of
    `Service.status`; this definition will soon be made
    final.

  * finagle-mux: Inject bound residual paths into mux requests.

  * *Request contexts.* Request contexts replace the direct use of
    com.twitter.util.Local and of com.twitter.finagle.Context.
    Request contexts are environments of request-local bindings;
    they are guaranteed to be delimited by Finagle,
    and their API admits only properly delimited binding.
    They come in two flavors:
    Contexts.local are always local to handling a single request;
    bindings in Contexts.broadcast may be marshalled and transmitted across process
    boundaries where there is protocol support.
    Currently, both Thrift and Mux (and thus also ThriftMux)
    support marshalled contexts.
    See `com.twitter.finagle.contexts.Context` for more details.


6.23.0
------

Breaking API Changes
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

  * finagle-core: `c.t.f.Stackable`s maintained state about which parameters were
    accessed via `get`. This was error prone and violated the assumption that `Stack`s
    are immutable data structures. We removed this in favor of annotating modules with
    parameters. The abstract classes for Stackables were also simplified. Now we only have
    `Module` and `ModuleN` variants which are more convenient for most definitions.
    Since this is an advanced API, it should not impact standard usage of finagle.
  * finagle-core: Update ConcurrentRingBuffer to use ClassTag instead of ClassManifest;
    rename size argument to capacity.

Deprecations
~~~~~~~~~~~~

  * `ServerBuilder.stack[Req1, Rep1](mk: Stack.Params => Server[Req1, Rep1])` is
    deprecated in favor of
    `ServerBuilder.stack[Req1, Rep1](server: Stack.Parameterized[Server[Req1, Rep1]])`

Runtime Behavior Changes
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

  * `finagle`: Improve allocation semantics for uses of Buf.

6.22.0
-------

Breaking API Changes
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

  * finagle-core: Removed unused `com.twitter.finagle.service.ProxyService`. It wasn't
    sufficiently general to be used outside of finagle, and was no longer used
    in finagle.
  * Removed TLSEngine, and replaced it with two, TLSClientEngine, and
    TLSServerEngine, where TLSServerEngine is the same as TLSEngine, and
    TLSClientEngine takes a SocketAddress instead of (). Additionally,
    the Netty3TransporterTLSConfig now takes a function SocketAddress => Engine,
    instead of () => Engine.

New Features
~~~~~~~~~~~~

  * finagle-core: BroadcastStatsReceiver, introduce specialized implementation
  * finagle-core: Introduce gauges in SummarizingStatsReceiver
  * finagle-core: Introduce Transport#copyToWriter
  * finagle-core: Make base Dtab used in BindingFactory a Stack.Param
  * finagle-core: Proper decay in experimental ewma load metric
  * finagle-core: Simplify Stack{Client, Server} and unify around them

  * finagle-core: clear locals before entering server dispatch loop
  * finagle-core: Defer DNS Resolution in InetResolver to FuturePool
  * finagle-core: for paths starting with /#/, skip rewrites where prefix is /
  * finagle-core: include name resolution in tracing request span
  * finagle-core: Properly wrap some IOException into ConnectionFailedException
  * finagle-core: Scope InetResolver's stats properly
  * finagle-http: Send "Connection: close" header while dispatcher is closing
  * finagle-http: Set content length header when appropriate
  * finagle-memcached: Use interruptible future for the client request readiness
  * finagle-stats: Add content-type response header to JsonExporter
  * finagle-thrift: Add back connection_preparation_latency stat in Thrift
  * finagle-thriftmux: Record protocol as a gauge rather than a counter

Documentation
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

  * finagle-core: Add Scaladocs for ChannelBufferBuf and BufChannelBuffer
  * finagle-core: link to the FAQ in FailedFastException
  * finagle-serversets: Defer DNS resolution for endpoints to InetResolver
  * finagle-thrift{,mux}: Clarified with* deprecation warning
  * Fix minor issues and missing code blocks in Finagle documentation

Optimization
~~~~~~~~~~~~

  * finagle-core: GlobalFlag isn't caching the property value
  * finagle-core: recursive-descent Path / NameTree / Dentry / Dtab parsers to reduce heap allocation

Bug Fixes
~~~~~~~~~

  * finagle-core: Fix a deadlock in Contexts
  * finagle-core: Fix breaking ABI change in SummarizingStatsReceiver
  * finagle-core: Fix bug in computing array index in SummarizingStatsReceiver

  * finagle-core: Synchronized access to the Stackable mutable.params map
  * finagle-http: Fix CookieMap.rewriteCookieHeaders()
  * finagle-http: Fix the memory leak in HttpClientDispatcher
  * finagle-mysql: Fix timestamp fractional seconds encoding
  * finagle-mysql: Properly heed timezone when extracting TimestampValue
  * mux: clear contexts after receive, not in 'finally' clause

- `exception cleanup`: wrap all Channel exceptions with their underlying exception. This makes UnknownChannelExceptions in particular easier to debug
- `Friendlier exceptions`: In order to give very specific error messages to timeouts in finagle (so beginners know which settings in the client and server builder caused them), I'm adding lots of human-readable messages to the various TimeoutExceptions.
- `some timer bug fixes, particularly`: TimerToNettyTimer: actually cancel underlying task.
