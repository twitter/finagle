/**
 * ZooKeeper sessions are resilient to failure. There are various levels of retry
 * functionality built into the stack to handle these expected events. However, all
 * states are reported to listeners making a status of 'unhealthy' temporarily
 * expected and possibly normal. (e.g. Zookeeper connection loadbalancing, rollout,
 * long GC pause on server or client side).
 *
 * The HealthStabilizer takes changing health status and hides 'unhealthy' status
 * changes until the client has been 'unhealthy' for at least one probation period.
