/**
 * Decode a stream of bytes into protocol frames based on length fields found
 * in the frames. Frames are returned when all bytes are present. This decoder
 * is stateful and accumulates partial frames, so it is not threadsafe.
 *
 * The length adjustment field is used to account for situations where there are
 * a fixed number of additional bytes, such as a header, in the frame which do
 * not count towards the value in the length field.
 *
 * Example: The frame consists of a 1-byte magic header, a 2-byte field which is
 * the length of data, the data itself, and finally a 1-byte hash. The total
 * size of the frame is 1 + 2 + (length of data) + 1. Therefore, lengthAdjust is
 * set to 4 to account for the additional bytes.
 *
 * {{{
 * new LengthFieldDecoder(
 *   lengthFieldBegin = 1,   // The length field starts at index 1
 *   lengthFieldLength = 2,  // The length field is 2 bytes
 *   lengthAdjust = 4,       // 1 byte magic + 2 bytes length + 1 byte hash
 *   maxFrameLength = 1024,
 *   bigEndian = true)
 * }}}
 *
 * @param lengthFieldBegin The offset at which the length field begins in bytes.
 * @param lengthFieldLength The number of bytes in the length field. This must
 *                          be 1, 2, 3, 4, or 8.
 * @param lengthAdjust A length field based frame will typically contain
 *                     additional bytes which are not counted by the value in
 *                     the length field itself. Length adjust is used to account
 *                     for such bytes. The final size of a decoded frame is
                       `lengthAdjust` + the value read in the length field
 * @param maxFrameLength The largest frame to expect including the size of the
 *                       `lengthAdjust`
 * @param bigEndian Set to false if the length field is little endian. This has
 *                  no effect on the rest of the frame.
