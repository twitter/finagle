/**
 * The threshold failure detector uses session pings to gauge the health

 * These RTTs are averaged over a number of observations.
 *
 * The session is marked [[Status.Busy]] until the first successful ping
 * response has been received.
 *
 * If a ping has been sent and has been outstanding for a time greater
 * than the threshold multiplied by the current exponential moving
 * average, the session is marked as [[Status.Busy]]. It is marked
 * [[Status.Open]] when the ping message returns.
 *
 * If `closeThreshold` is positive and no ping responses has been received
 * during a window of `closeThreshold * ema.last`, then the `close`
 * function is called.
 *
 * This scheme is pretty conservative, but it requires fairly little a priori
 * knowledge: the parameters are used only to tune its sensitivity to
 * history and to bound its failure detection time. The time to detection
 * is bounded by the ping period plus the threshold multiplied by the
 * average ping RTT.
