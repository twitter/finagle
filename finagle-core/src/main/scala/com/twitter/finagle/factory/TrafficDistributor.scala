/**
 * A traffic distributor groups the input `dest` into distinct weight classes and

 * instances in `dest`. The class operates with the following regime:

 * 1. For every distinct [[SocketAddress]] observed in `dest`, it creates a `newEndpoint`.
 * Each resulting `newEndpoint` is paired with a weight extracted from the [[SocketAddress]].
 * Calls to `newEndpoint` are assumed to be expensive, so they are cached by input address.
 *
 * 2. The weighted endpoints are partitioned into weight classes and each class is
 * serviced by a distinct `newBalancer` instance. That is, load offered to a weight
 * class is also load balanced across its members. Offered load is distributed according
 * to the classes weight and number of members that belong to the class.
 *
 * @param eagerEviction When set to false, a SocketAddress cache entry is only removed
 * when its associated [[ServiceFactory]] has a status that is not Status.Open. This allows
 * for stale cache entries across updates that are only evicted when a [[ServiceFactory]]
 * is no longer eligible to receive traffic (as indicated by its `status` field).
