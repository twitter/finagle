Finagle is an extensible RPC system for the JVM, used to construct
high-concurrency servers. Finagle implements uniform client and server APIs for
several protocols, and is designed for high performance and concurrency. Most of
Finagleâ€™s code is protocol agnostic, simplifying the implementation of new
protocols.
