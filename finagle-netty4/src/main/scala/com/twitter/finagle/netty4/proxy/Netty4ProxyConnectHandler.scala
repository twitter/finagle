/**
 * An internal handler that upgrades the pipeline to delay connect-promise satisfaction until the
 * handshake (either HTTP or SOCKS5) with a proxy server (represented by a `proxyAddress`) succeeds.
 *
 * This handler is layered on top of Netty's [[ProxyHandler]] that represents a proxy
 * address as a [[SocketAddress]], which will likely be resolved before it's passed into a handler
 * constructor. This means, a single destination to a server will be used across a Finagle
 * client, which makes it quite sensitive to proxy server failures. With that said, this handler
 * is designed and implemented exclusively for testing/development, not for production usage.
 *
 * For production traffic, an HTTP proxy (see [[HttpProxyConnectHandler]]) should be used instead.
 *
 * @note This handler doesn't buffer any writes assuming that this is done by [[ProxyHandler]] that
 *       is placed before.
