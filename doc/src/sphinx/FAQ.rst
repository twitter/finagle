General Finagle FAQ
-------------------

.. _propagate_failure:

What are CancelledRequestException and CancelledConnectionException?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

When a client connected to a Finagle server disconnects, the server raises
a *cancellation* interrupt on the pending Future. This is done to
conserve resources and avoid unnecessary work: the upstream
client may have timed the request out, for example. Interrupts on
futures propagate, and so if that server is in turn waiting for a response
from a downstream server it will cancel this pending request, and so on.

The topology, visually:

``Upstream ---> (Finagle Server -> Finagle Client) ---> Downstream``

Interrupts propagate between the Finagle Server and Client only if the
Future returned from the Server is chained [#]_ to the Client.

A simplified code snippet that exemplifies the intra-process structure:

::

  val client = Mysql.newService(...)
  val service: Service[Req, Rep] = new Service[Req, Rep] {
    def apply(req: Req): Future[Rep] = {
      client(...)
    }
  }
  val server = Http.serve(..., service)

.. [#] "Chained" in this context means that calling `Future#raise`
       will reach the interrupt handler on the Future that represents
       the rpc call to the client. This is clearly the case in the above
       example where the call to the client is indeed the returned Future.
       However, this will still hold if the client call was in the context
       of a Future combinator (ex. `Future#select`, `Future#join`, etc.)

This is the source of the :API:`CancelledRequestException <com.twitter.finagle.CancelledRequestException>` --
when a Finagle client receives the cancellation interrupt while a request is pending, it
fails that request with this exception. A special case of this is when a request is in the process
of establishing a session and is instead interrupted with a :API:`CancelledConnectException <com.twitter.finagle.CancelledConnectException>`

You can disable this behavior by using the :API:`MaskCancelFilter <com.twitter.finagle.filter.MaskCancelFilter>`:

::

	val service: Service[Req, Rep] = ...
	val masked = new MaskCancelFilter[Req, Rep]

	val maskedService = masked andThen service

Note that most protocols do not natively support request cancellations
(though modern RPC protocols like :doc:`Mux <Protocols>`
do). In practice, this means that for these protocols, we need to disconnect
the client to signal cancellation, which in turn can cause undue connection
churn.

Why is com.twitter.common.zookeeper#server-set not found?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Some of our libraries still aren't published to maven central.  If you add

::

	resolvers += "twitter" at "http://maven.twttr.com"

to your sbt configuration, it will be able to pick up the libraries which are
published externally, but not yet to maven central.

.. _configuring_finagle6:

How do I configure clients and servers with Finagle 6 APIs?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

As of :doc:`6.x <changelog>`, We introduced a new, preferred API for constructing Finagle ``Client``\s and ``Server``\s.
Where the old API used ``ServerBuilder``\/``ClientBuilder`` with Codecs, the new APIs use
``Proto.newClient`` [#]_.

Old APIs:

::

	val client = ClientBuilder()
	  .codec(Http)
	  .hosts("localhost:10000,localhost:10001,localhost:10003")
	  .hostConnectionLimit(1)
	  .build()

New APIs:

::

	val client = Http.newService("localhost:10000,localhost:10001")

The new APIs make timeouts more explicit, but we think we have a pretty good reason
for changing the API this way.

Timeouts are typically used in two cases:

A.  Liveness detection (TCP connect timeout)
B.  Application requirements (global timeout)

For liveness detection, it is actually fine for timeouts to be long.  We have a
default of 1 second.

For application requirements, you can use a service normally and then use
`Future#raiseWithin`.

::

	val get: Future[HttpResponse] = Http.fetchUrl("http://twitter.com/")
	get.raiseWithin(1.ms)

We found that having all of the extremely granular timeouts was making it harder
for people to use Finagle, since it was hard to reason about what all of the
timeouts did without knowledge of Finagle internals.  How is `tcpConnectTimeout`
different from `connectTimeout`?  How is a `requestTimeout` different from a
`timeout`?  What is an `idleReaderTimeout`?  How is it different from
`idleWriterTimeout`?  People would often cargo-cult bad configuration settings,
and it would be difficult to recover from the bad situation.  We also found that
they were rarely being used correctly, and usually only by very sophisticated
users.

We're encouraging users to avoid encoding application requirements in Finagle,
which was previously too easy to do via methods like `ClientBuilder#retries`, or
`ClientBuilder#timeout`.  These are fundamentally application-level concerns--
you're trying to meet an SLA, etc.  In general, in order to do what Finagle is
for, which is to deliver an rpc message to a cluster, we don't think you should
need a lot of configuration at all.  You should need to specify your protocol,
and a few details about the transport (ssl?  no ssl?), but that's about it.

Of course, there are some points where there are rough edges, and we haven't
figured out exactly what the right default should be.  We're actively looking
for input, and would love for the greater Finagle community to help us find good
defaults. We've also been experimenting with some new abstractions that should
make configuration a lot more flexible. Stay tuned and of course reach out to
the mailing list with any questions.

.. [#] Protocol implementors are encouraged to provide sensible
       defaults and leave room for application specific behavior
       to be built on top of the base layer via filters or
       synchronization mechanisms.

.. _faq_failedfastexception:

Why do clients see com.twitter.finagle.FailedFastException's?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

While the :src:`FailFast <com/twitter/finagle/service/FailFastFactory.scala>` service
factory generally shields clients from downed hosts, sometimes clients will see
:src:`FailedFastExceptions <com/twitter/finagle/Exceptions.scala>`.
A common cause is when all endpoints in the load balancer's pool are
marked down as fail fast, then the load balancer will pass requests through, resulting in a
``com.twitter.finagle.FailedFastException``.

A related issue is when the load balancer's pool is a single endpoint that is itself a
load balancer (for example an nginx server or a hardware load balancer).
It is important to disable fail fast as the remote load balancer has
the visibility into which endpoints are up.
Disabling fail fast can be done with ``ClientBuilder``:

::

  clientBuilder.failFast(false)

Refer to the :ref:`fail fast <client_fail_fast>` section for further context.

Mux-specific FAQ
----------------

What service behavior will change when upgrading to Mux?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

*Connecting Pooling Metrics*

With Mux, Finagle multiplexes several requests onto a single connection. As a
consequence, traditional forms of connection-pooling are no longer required. Thus
Mux employs `com.twitter.finagle.pool.SingletonPool <http://twitter.github.io/finagle/docs/#com.twitter.finagle.pool.SingletonPool>`_,
which exposes new stats:

- ``connects``, ``connections``, and ``closechans`` stats should drop, since
  there will be less channel opening and closing.
- ``connection_duration``, ``connection_received_bytes``, and
  ``connection_sent_bytes`` stats should increase, since connections become more
  long-lived.
- ``connect_latency_ms`` and ``failed_connect_latency_ms`` stats may become
  erratic because their sampling will become more sparse.
- ``pool_cached``, ``pool_waiters``, ``pool_num_waited``, ``pool_size`` stats all
  pertain to connection pool implementations not used by Mux, so they disappear
  from stats output.

*ClientBuilder configuration*

Certain `ClientBuilder <http://twitter.github.io/finagle/docs/#com.twitter.finagle.builder.ClientBuilder>`_
settings related to connection pooling become obsolete:
``hostConnectionCoresize``, ``hostConnectionLimit``, ``hostConnectionIdleTime``,
``hostConnectionMaxWaiters``, ``hostConnectionMaxIdleTime``,
``hostConnectionMaxLifeTime``, and ``hostConnectionBufferSize``

*Server Connection Stats*

The server-side connection model changes as well. Expect the following stats to
be impacted:

- ``connects``, ``connections``, and ``closechans`` stats should drop.
- ``connection_duration``, ``connection_received_bytes``, and
  ``connection_sent_bytes`` should increase.
- Obsolete stats: ``idle/idle``, ``idle/refused``, and ``idle/closed``

*ServerBuilder configuration*
Certain `ServerBuilder <http://twitter.github.io/finagle/docs/#com.twitter.finagle.builder.ServerBuilder>`_
connection management settings become obsolete: ``openConnectionsThresholds``,
``hostConnectionMaxIdleTime``, and ``hostConnectionMaxLifeTime``.

What is ThriftMux?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

`ThriftMux <http://twitter.github.io/finagle/docs/#com.twitter.finagle.ThriftMux$>`_
is an implementation of the Thrift protocol built on top of Mux.
