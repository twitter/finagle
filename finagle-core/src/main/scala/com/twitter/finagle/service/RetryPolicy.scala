   * signals supplied by things like failure rates or latency, which allows `RetryPolicy`s
   * to dynamically reduce the number of retries in response to backpressure.
   *
   * The predicate function is only called on the first failure in a chain. Any additional

   *
   * One example where this is useful is to dynamically and fractionally allow retries based
   * upon backpressure signals.  If, for example, the predicate function returned true or false
   * based upon a probability distribution computed from a backpressure signal, it could return
   * true 50% of the time, giving you a 50% chance of performing a single retry, a 25% chance of
   * performing 2 retries, 12.5% chance of performing 3 retries, etc.  This might be more
