This is a transitional package to support the migration to Netty4.
It separates the duplicated TwitterCacheResolver from finagle-memcached
and finagle-memcachedx.

Once the Netty4 migration is complete and we again have only one
implementation of finagle-memcached this package can be deleted and
the TwitterCacheResolver moved back into the unified finagle-memcached
package.
