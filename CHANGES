~~~~~

Released 2011/11/08

- `SSL`: make native provider bootstrapping code work; refactor 'Ssl' singleton
- `tracing`: Update configurations and libraries to use tracer factory introduced to make it possible to release resources properly in tracers
- `finagle-thrift`: connection options + client id
- a more flexible retry filter

1.9.5
~~~~~

Released 2011/11/04

- `ExpiringService`: add stats for idle and lifetime expiration. Deactivate() regardless of latch counter
- `Filters`: don't apply refcounts on composition, do it only (and always) in the builder
- Count pending timeouts, and export them
- `ChannelService`: release services when `prepareChannel` fails. This fixes a connection leak
- `WatermarkPool`: flush waiters on creation failure. This fixes a condition wherein we'd keep waiters unnecessarily.
- `Timeout exceptions`: include service name
- Suppress excessive logging of the exceptions that mostly caused by unreliable client connections.
- `memcached`: Add generic type support (via Client.adapt), and Array[Byte] and String instances
- `finagle-stream`: do not admit concurrent requests
- `Tracing`: Add release method to Tracer trait, add tracerFactory to builders, deprecate tracer on builders

1.9.4
~~~~~

Released 2011/10/24

- `Service`: response Future will now be cancelled if the client disconnects
- use static exceptions for TimedOutRequestException
- `kestrel`: Cancel request Future on close in kestrel ReadHandle
- `exception cleanup`: wrap all Channel exceptions with their underlying exception. This makes UnknownChannelExceptions in particular easier to debug
- `Friendlier exceptions`: In order to give very specific error messages to timeouts in finagle (so beginners know which settings in the client and server builder caused them), I'm adding lots of human-readable messages to the various TimeoutExceptions.
- `some timer bug fixes, particularly`: TimerToNettyTimer: actually cancel underlying task.

1.9.2
~~~~~

Released 2011/10/14

- `tracing`: Change SpanId to use RichU64String
- `tracing`: Trace.{enable,disable}

- `http`: add common media types

1.9.1
~~~~~

~~~~~

Released 2011/08/12

- `thrift`: add a server-side buffered codec; fix tracing issue in buffered codec
- `http`: workaround hole in netty logic to guarantee maxRequestSize
- `serversets`: don't block on ClientBuilder construction
- `ostrich4`: update to ostrich 4.8.2
- `streaming`: reimplement HTTP chunked streaming in terms of offer/broker
- `kestrel`: buffered & merging of ReadHandles

1.8.1
~~~~~

Released 2011/08/05

- upgrade to netty 3.2.5.Final
- `kestrel`: fix visibility of ResultWithCAS
- `kestrel`: Client.{read,write}, Client.readReliably, MultiReader: suite of kestrel streaming readers (including grabby-hands replacements) using Offer/Broker
- `kestrel`: don't render timeouts > 2^31-1
- `tracing`: fix sampling bug
- `tracing`: trace the kestrel client
- quench unecessary error reporting

1.8.0
~~~~~

Released 2011/08/02

- `SSL`: perform hostname validation in the client. this is the reason for the minor bump: we change the .tls() ClientBuilder signature
- introduce util-codec dependency for use of the apache commons base 64 codec

1.7.5
~~~~~

Released 2011/07/29


- make it easier to use the NullStatsReceiver from java
- convert WriteException to a case class (github issue 25)
- add _root_. to java.util.Map import. reorder imports
- Upgrade finagle-common-stats to twitter-common-stats 0.0.16
- encode more HTTP codec errors
- adding cardinality to ServiceException
- `finagle CachingPool`: limit size to highWatermark - lowWatermark
- `exception reporting`: gzipping trace strings
- set ostrich version of finagle-ostrich4 to 4.7.3
- `ChannelServiceFactory`: encode exceptions from bootstrap.connect()

1.7.4
~~~~~

Released 2011/07/22

- `fix`: 1.7.2 introduced a regression in the pool that may, under certain circumstances, admit connections beyond the high watermark.
- quench exception for setting multiple Promise values when racing with write errors.
- Adds tracing support for the Memcached client. This only creates the client side annotations, no support for passing along ids and such to the memcached server.

~~~~~

Released 2011/07/18


- support end-to-end cancellation in finagle clients; fixes possible pool starvation conditions, and allows clients to cancel requests and reclaim resources
- `end-to-end timeouts`: introduce, .connectTimeout and .timeout. .connectTimeout is the end-to-end connection timeout (includes acquisition & TCP time), .timeout is an end-to-end request time: no requests will take longer
- some doc fixes
- misc. bug fixes
