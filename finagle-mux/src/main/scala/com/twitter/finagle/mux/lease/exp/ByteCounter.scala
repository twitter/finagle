 * WindowedByteCounter is a [[java.lang.Thread]] which sleeps for period P, and
 * after waking up, adds to an Array how many bytes were allocated while it
 * slept.  This means that the rate is windowed.  It also keeps track of the
 * last time that we did a garbage collection.
 *
 * iiii|iii|iiii|iii|iiii|iii|iiii/ii
 *
 * Every i is the thread waking up and counting the number of bytes that have
 * changed collection.  Every | is where a garbage collection is.  We also store
 * the most recent garbage collection, which is denoted by the /.  There's a
 * period P that passes between each i, so we know when a garbage collection
 * occurred precise to within period P.
 *
 * Knowing the rate is useful for guessing when our next gc will happen, and how
 * long we should wait for outstanding requests to finish draining.
