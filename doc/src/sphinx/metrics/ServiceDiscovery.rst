Name Resolution
<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<

Finagle clients resolve :doc:`names <Names>` into sets of network
addresses to which sockets can be opened. A number of the moving parts
involved in this process are cached (i.e. `Dtab`\s, `Name`\s, and
`NameTree`\s). The following stats are recorded under the
`namer/{dtabcache,namecache,nametreecache}` scopes to provide
visibility into this caching.

**misses**
  A counter of the number of cache misses

**misstime_ms**
  A histogram of the latency, in milliseconds, of invocation of
  `Service`\s created on misses

**evicts**
  A counter of the number of cache evictions

**idle**
  A gauge of the number of cached idle `ServiceFactory`\s

**oneshots**
  A counter of the number of "one-off" `ServiceFactory`\s that are
  created in the event that no idle `ServiceFactory`\s are cached

The total time spent resolving Names is captured in the
`namer/bind_latency_us` stat.

Address Stabilization
<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<

Resolved addresses (represented as an instance of
`com.twitter.finagle.Addr`) are stabilized in two ways:

1. ZooKeeper failures will not cause a previously bound address to fail.
2. When a member leaves a cluster, its removal is delayed.

Note that hosts added to a cluster are reflected immediately.

The following metrics are scoped under the concatenation of `zk2/` and
the ServerSet's ZooKeeper path.

**limbo**
  A gauge tracking the number of endpoints that are in "limbo". When a
  member leaves a cluster, it is placed in limbo. Hosts in limbo are
  still presented to the load balancer as belonging to the cluster,
  but are staged for removal. They are removed if they do not recover
  within an interval bound by the ZooKeeper session timeout.

**size**
  A gauge tracking the total size of the live cluster, not including
  members in limbo.

**observed_serversets**
  A gauge tracking the number of clusters whose membership status is
  *currently* been tracked within the process. This metric differs from
  `session_cache_size` below in that it tracks live clusters rather
  than the total number of cached sessions.

ZooKeeper Diagnostics
<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<

The following stats reflect diagnostic information about the ZooKeeper
sessions opened for the purposes of service discovery.
