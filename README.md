# Finagle

Finagle is a library for building *asynchronous* RPC servers and clients in Java, Scala, or any JVM language. Built atop [Netty](http://www.jboss.org/netty), Finagle provides a rich set of tools that are protocol independent.

Finagle is flexible enough to support a variety of RPC styles, including request-response, streaming, and pipelining (e.g., HTTP pipelining and Redis pipelining). It also makes it easy to work with stateful RPC styles (e.g., those requiring authentication and those that support transactions).

### Examples

I think the best way to start is to look at examples:

* [Echo](https://github.com/twitter/finagle/tree/master/finagle-example/src/main/scala/com/twitter/finagle/example/echo) - A simple echo client and server using a newline-delimited protocol. Illustrates the basics of asynchronous control-flow.
* [Http](https://github.com/twitter/finagle/tree/master/finagle-example/src/main/scala/com/twitter/finagle/example/http) - An advanced HTTP client and server that illustrates the use of Filters to compositionally organize your code. Filters are used here to isolate authentication and error handling concerns.
* [Memcached Proxy](https://github.com/twitter/finagle/tree/master/finagle-example/src/main/scala/com/twitter/finagle/example/memcachedproxy) - A simple proxy supporting the Memcached protocol.
* [Stream](https://github.com/twitter/finagle/tree/master/finagle-example/src/main/scala/com/twitter/finagle/example/stream) - An illustration of Channels, the abstraction for Streaming protocols.
* [Spritzer 2 Kestrel](https://github.com/twitter/finagle/tree/master/finagle-example/src/main/scala/com/twitter/finagle/example/spritzer2kestrel) - An illustration of Channels, the abstraction for Streaming protocols. Here the Twitter Firehose is "piped" into a Kestrel message queue, illustrating some of the composability of Channels.
* [Stress](https://github.com/twitter/finagle/tree/master/finagle-example/src/main/scala/com/twitter/finagle/example/stress) - A high-throughput HTTP client for driving stressful traffic to an HTTP server. Illustrates more advanced asynchronous control-flow.
* [Thrift](https://github.com/twitter/finagle/tree/master/finagle-example/src/main/scala/com/twitter/finagle/example/thrift) - A simple client and server for a Thrift protocol.

But a great way to start might be to read the following conceptual overview:

### Conceptual Overview

Here is a simple HTTP server and client. The server returns a simple HTTP 200 response:

### Scala

    val service: Service[HttpRequest, HttpResponse] = new Service[HttpRequest, HttpResponse] {
      def apply(request: HttpRequest) = Future(new DefaultHttpResponse(HTTP_1_1, OK))
    }

    val address: SocketAddress = new InetSocketAddress(10000)

    val server: Server[HttpRequest, HttpResponse] = ServerBuilder()
      .codec(Http)
      .bindTo(address)
      .build(service)

The client connects to the server, and issues a simple HTTP GET request:

    val client: Service[HttpRequest, HttpResponse] = ClientBuilder()
      .codec(Http)
      .hosts(address)
      .build()

    // Issue a request, get a response:
    val request: HttpRequest = new DefaultHttpRequest(HTTP_1_1, GET, "/")
    val responseFuture: Future[HttpResponse] = client(request)

    // all done!
    client.close()
    server.close()

Note that the variable `responseFuture` in this example is of type `Future[HttpResponse]`, which represents an asynchronous HTTP response (i.e., a response that will arrive sometime later). With a `Future` object, you can express your program in either a synchronous or asynchronous style: the program can either 1) block, awaiting the response, or 2) provide a callback to be invoked when a response is available. For example,

### Scala

     // (1) Synchronously await the response for up to 1 second, then print:
     println(responseFuture(1.second))

     // (2) Alternatively, when the response arrives, invoke the callback, then print:
     responseFuture onSuccess { response =>
       println(response)
     }

`Futures` allow the programmer to easily express a number of powerful idioms such as pipelining, scatter-gather, timeouts, and error handling. See the section "Using Futures" for more information.

## Services

In Finagle, RPC Servers are built out of `Services` and `Filters`. A `Service` is a simply a function that receives a request and returns a `Future` of a response. For example, here is a service that increments a number by one.

### Scala

    val plusOneService = new Service[Int, Int] {
      def apply(request: Int) = Future { request + 1 }                                  // (1)
    }

Note that `plusOneService` acts as if it were asynchronous despite that it is not doing any asynchronous work. It adheres to the `Service[Req, Rep]` contract by wrapping the synchronously computed response in a "constant" `Future` of type `Future[Int]`.

More sophisticated `Services` than `plusOneService` might make truly asynchronous calls (e.g., by making further RPC calls or by scheduling work in a queue), and `apply` having a return type of `Future[Rep]` is general enough to handle most cases.

Once you have defined your `Service`, it can be bound to a SocketAddress, thus becoming an RPC Server:

    ServerBuilder()
      .bindTo(address)
      .codec(...)
      .build(plusOneService)

### Filters

However, an RPC Server must speak a specific codec/protocol. One nice way to design an RPC Server is to decouple the protocol handling code from the implementation of the business rules. For example, we can have an adding service exposed via HTTP and Thrift. A `Filter` provides a easy way to do this.

Here is a `Filter` that adapts the `HttpRequest => HttpResponse` protocol to the `Int => Int` `plusOneService`:

### Scala

    val httpToIntFilter = new Filter[HttpRequest, HttpResponse, Int, Int] {              // (1)
      def apply(httpRequest: HttpRequest, intService: Service[Int, Int]) = {
        val intRequest = httpRequest.getContent.toString(CharsetUtil.UTF_8).toInt
        intService(intRequest) map { intResponse =>                                      // (2)
          val httpResponse = new DefaultHttpResponse(HTTP_1_1, OK)
          httpResponse.setContent(intResponse.toString.getBytes)
          httpResponse
        }
      }
    }

    val httpPlusOneService: Service[HttpRequest, HttpResponse] =
      httpToIntFilter.andThen(plusOneService)                                            // (3)

This example illustrates three important concepts:

1. A `Filter` wraps a `Service` and (potentially) converts the input and output types of the service to other types. Here `Int => Int` is mapped to `HttpRequest => HttpResponse`.
1. The result of a `Future[A]` computation can be converted to a `Future[B]` computation by calling the `map` function. This function is applied asynchronously and is analogous to the `map` function on sequences used in many programming languages. See the section "Using Futures" for more information.
1. A `Filter` is wrapped around a `Service` by calling the `andThen` function. Any number of `Filters` can be composed using `andThen`, as we will see shortly.

Let's consider a more involved example. Often it is nice to isolate distinct phases of your application into a pipeline, and `Filters` provide a great way to accomplish this. In order to prevent `Integer Overflow` errors, our `Service` will check that the request is `< 2**32 - 1`:

### Scala

    val preventOverflowFilter = new SimpleFilter[Int, Int] {                             // (1)
      def apply(request: Int, continue: Service[Int, Int]) =
        if (request < Int.MaxValue)
          continue(request)
        else
          Future.exception(new OverflowException)                                        // (2)
    }

### Notes

1. A `SimpleFilter` is a kind of `Filter` that does not convert the request and response types. It saves a little bit of typing.
1. An exception can be returned asynchronously by calling `Future.exception`. See the section "Using Futures" for more information.

Another `Filter` typical of an RPC Service is authentication and authorization. Our `Service` wants to ensure that the user is authorized to perform addition:

### Scala

    val ensureAuthorizedFilter = new SimpleFilter[HttpRequest, HttpResponse] {
      def apply(request: HttpRequest, continue: Service[Int, Int]) =
        if (request.getHeader("Authorization") == "Basic ...")
          continue(request)
        else
          Future.exception(new UnauthorizedException)
    }


Finally, all of the `Filters` can be composed with our `Service` in the following way:

    val myService =
      ensureAuthorizedFilter andThen
      httpToIntFilter        andThen
      preventOverflowFilter  andThen
      plusOneService

## Building a robust RPC client

Finagle makes it easy to build RPC clients with connection pooling, load balancing, logging, and statistics reporting:

### Scala

    val client = ClientBuilder()
        .codec(Http)
        .hosts("localhost:10000,localhost:10001,localhost:10003")
        .connectionTimeout(1.second)        // max time to spend establishing a TCP connection.
        .retries(2)                         // (1) per-request retries
        .reportTo(new OstrichStatsReceiver) // export host-level load data to ostrich
        .logger(Logger.getLogger("http"))
        .build()

This creates a load balanced HTTP client that balances requests among 3 (local) endpoints. The balancing strategy is to pick the endpoint with the least number of outstanding requests (this is similar to "least connections" in other load balancers). The load-balancer deliberately introduces jitter to avoid synchronicity (and thundering herds) in a distributed system. **In general a lot of thought has gone into making robust load-balancing and failover.**

### Notes

1. If retries are specified (using `retries(n: Int)`), Finagle will retry the request in the event of an error, up to the number of times specified. Finagle **does not assume your RPC service is Idempotent**. Retries occur only in the event of TCP-related `WriteExceptions`, where we are certain the RPC has not been transmitted to the remote server.

Once you have constructed a client, a request is issued like this:

### Scala

    val request: HttpRequest = new DefaultHttpRequest(HTTP_1_1, Get, "/")
    val futureResponse: Future[HttpResponse] = client(request)

### Java

    HttpRequest request = new DefaultHttpRequest(HTTP_1_1, Get, "/")
    Future<HttpResponse> futureResponse = client.apply(request)

### Timeouts

A robust way to use RPC clients is to have an upper-bound on how long to wait for a response to arrive. With `Futures`, there are two ways to do this: synchronously and asynchrously. 1) The synchronous technique is to block, waiting for a response to arrive, and throw an exception if it does not arrive in time. 2) The asynchronous way is to register a callback to handle the result if it arrives in time, and invoke another callback if it fails.

### Scala

    // (1) synchronous timeouts
    try {
      val response = futureResponse(1.second)
    } catch {
      case e: TimeoutException => ...
    }

    // (2) asynchronous timeouts require an (implicit) Timer object
    import com.twitter.finagle.util.Timer._

    futureResponse.within(1.second) onSuccess { response =>
      println("yay it worked: " + response)
    } onFailure {
      case e: TimeoutException => ...
    }

## Using Futures

Finagle uses `com.twitter.util.Futures` as the unifying abstraction for all asynchronous computation. A `Future` represents a computation that has not yet completed, and that can succeed or fail. The two most basic ways to use a `Future` is to 1) wait for the computation to return, or 2) register a callback to be invoked when the computation eventually succeeds or fails.

In the example below, we define a function `f` that takes an `Int` and returns a `Future[Int]`. It errors if given an odd number.

[See the Scaladoc](http://twitter.github.com/util/util-core/target/site/doc/main/api/com/twitter/util/Future.html)

### Scala

    def f(a: Int): Future[Int] =
      if (a % 2 == 0)
        Future.value(a)
      else
        Future.exception(new OddNumberException)

    val myFuture: Future[Int] = f(2)

    // an alternative way to define the function `f`:

    def f(a: Int): Future[Int] = Future {
      if (a % 2 == 0) a
      else throw new OddNumberException
    }

    // 1) Wait 1 second the for computation to return
    try {
      println(myFuture(1.second))
    } catch {
      case e: TimeoutException   => ...
      case e: OddNumberException => ...
    }

    // 2) Invoke a callback when the computation succeeds or fails
    myFuture onSuccess { i =>
      println(i)
    } onFailure { e =>
      println("uh oh!")
    } ensure {
      externalResources.release()
    }

In addition to waiting for results to return, `Futures` can be transformed in interesting ways. For instance, it is possible to convert a `Future[String]` to a `Future[Int]` by using `map`:

    val stringFuture: Future[String] = Future("1")
    val intFuture: Future[Int] = stringFuture map (_.toInt)

Similar to `map`, there is `flatMap`. This allows you to easily "pipeline" a sequence of `Futures`:

    val authenticateUser: Future[User] = User.authenticate(email, password)
    val lookupTweets: Future[Seq[Tweet]] = authenticateUser flatMap { user =>
      Tweet.findAllByUser(user)
    }

In this example, `Tweet.findAllByUser(user)` is a function of type `User => Future[Seq[Tweet]]`.

As a final example of `Futures` let's consider the problem of scatter/gather patterns. The challenge is to issue a series of requests in parallel and wait for all of them to arrive. Suppose for example, we have a sequence of `Futures`. To wait for all to return, we do like so:

    val myFutures: Seq[Future[Int]] = ...

    val waitTillAllComplete: Future[Seq[Int]] = Future.collect(myFutures)

A more complex variation of scatter/gather is to perform a sequence of asynchronous operations and harvest only those that return within a certain time -- using a default value for those that don't return. A concrete example might be to issue a set of parallel requests to N partitions of a search index; those that don't return in time we consider to have returned the empty set.

    import com.twitter.finagle.util.Timer._

    val results: Seq[Future[Result]] = partitions.map { partition =>
      partition.get(query).within(1.second) handle {
        case _: TimeoutException => EmptyResult
      }
    }
    val allResults: Future[Seq[Result]] = Future.collect(timedResults)

    // Process the results asynchronously.
    // Note: this takes no longer than 1 second.
    allResults onSuccess { results =>
      println(results)
    }

## Streaming Protocols

Finagle makes streaming and pubsub-like RPCs easy. Streams rely on a generalization of `Futures` called `Channels`. `Channels` represent a stream of events that can be listened to. To publish and subscribe to a `Channel`, do the following:

[See the Scaladoc](http://twitter.github.com/util/util-core/target/site/doc/main/api/com/twitter/util/Channel.html)

    // a ChannelSource is a readable-writable stream of messages, whereas a Channel is only readable.
    val source = new ChannelSource[Int]
    val sink: Channel = source

    // start listening for messages:
    val observer1 = sink respond { message =>
      Future { println("1: " + message) }                              // (1)
    }
    val observer2 = sink respond { message =>                          // (2)
      Future { println("2: " + message) }
    }

    // send some messages on the channel
    source.send(1)
    source.send(2)
    // etc.

    // stop listening for messages:
    observer1.dispose()

### Notes

1. Subscribers must return a `Future` indicating when processing of the received message is complete. This allows consumers to exhibit backpressure to producers.
1. Just as with `Futures` there can be any number of responders to a `Channel`.

`Channels` have some of the usual sequence operations such as `map` and `filter`:

    val channel = new ChannelSource[Int]
    val evenChannel = channel filter (_ % 2 == 0)
    val stringChannel = channel map (_.toString)

Most of the tricky issues concerning `Channels` involve data-loss and backpressure. In order to ensure that no data is lost, a typical pattern is not to broadcast on a `Channel` until there is at least one subscriber. This is easily accomplished:

    channel.responds.first { _ =>                                       // (1) (2)
      // the first responder has arrived, start sending!
      // ...
    }

### Notes

1. `channel.responds` is a `Channel` itself. In other words, every `Channel` has a sub-channel indicating when subscribers subscribe (and unsubscribe!).
1. `channel.first` is a `Future` indicating when the first message arrives on that `Channel`.

However, a more robust producer stops producing when all consumers `dispose()`. This is easily accomplished.

    channel.numObservers.respond { i =>
      i match {
        case 0 => start()
        case 1 => stop()
        case _ => // continue
      }
      Future.Done
    }

Backpressure (that is, slowing down production if consumers get backed up) is also easily accomplished. The `channel.send` method returns a `Seq[Future[Unit]]` -- a sequence of `Futures` indicating when all consumers have processed the message. You can use `Future.join` to slow down production in the following way:

    Future.join(channel.send(1)) onSuccess { _ =>
      Future.join(channel.send(2)) onSuccess { ... }
    }

You can use recursion to send 10 messages, throttled by consumer performance. Additionally, Future provides a number of control flow constructs that are useful:

    val i = new AtomicInteger(0)
    Future.times(10) { channel.send(i.getAndIncrement()) } // (1)

### Notes

1. Future has methods like times(), parallel(), and whileDo() that implement advanced control-flow patterns.

With `Channels`, building a streaming RPC service is straightforward. You will need a codec that supports streaming (such as HTTP with chunked encoding). Then, build a `Service` that returns a `Channel`:

    val channel = new ChannelSource[ChannelBuffer]
    val myService = new Service[HttpRequest, Channel[ChannelBuffer]] {
      def apply(request: HttpRequest) = Future.value(channel)
    }

Some incomplete API documentation is available: See [scaladoc](http://twitter.github.com/finagle/).

## Serversets

`finagle-serversets` is an implementation of the Finagle Cluster interface using `com.twitter.com.zookeeper` [ServerSets](http://twitter.github.com/commons/pants.doc/index.html#com.twitter.common.zookeeper.ServerSet).

Here's how to use it:

### Instantiate a ServerSet and a Cluster

    val serverSet = new ServerSetImpl(zookeeperClient, "/twitter/services/silly")
    val cluster = new ZookeeperServerSetCluster(serverSet)

### If you're a Server, join the Cluster:

    val serviceAddress = new InetSocketAddress(...)
    val server = ServerBuilder()
      .bindTo(serviceAddress)
      .build()

    cluster.join(serviceAddress)

### If you're a Client,

    val client = ClientBuilder()
      .cluster(cluster) // check this out!!
      .codec(new StringCodec)
      .build()

That's it!
